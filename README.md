build-free-boilerplate
======================

In a time where even for a "Hello World" project, you need to setup a whole build/transpile pipeline with webpack (or other tools), the goal of this project is to:

* have a simple starter kit
* without any build tool to configure
* directly using UMD build
* with a few simple examples (for ES6, React ...)

## Main purpose

You may not use that kind of boilerplate for production but for practice or teaching purpose.

## Install

```
npm install
```

## Run

```
npm start
```

Goto [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

This is a work in progress.
